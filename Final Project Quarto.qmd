## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#Q1: Create descriptive statistics table
tbl_summary(
	Pride_Index_Data,
	include = c(rating, students,
							community_type, public, private, doctoral, masters, baccalaureate,
							community, residential, nonresidential, liberal_arts, technical, religious,
							military, hbcu, hispanic_serving, aapi_serving, other_minority_serving),
	label = list(
		rating ~ "Acceptance Rating",
		students ~ "Number of Students",
		community_type ~ "Type of Community",
		public ~ "Public",
		private ~ "Private",
		doctoral ~ "Doctoral",
		masters ~ "Masters",
		baccalaureate ~ "Baccalaureate",
		community ~ "Community",
		residential ~ "Residential",
		nonresidential ~ "Nonresidential",
		liberal_arts ~ "Liberal Arts",
		technical ~ "Technical",
		religious ~ "Religious",
		military ~ "Military",
		hbcu ~ "HBCU",
		hispanic_serving ~ "Hispanic Serving",
		aapi_serving ~ "AAPI Serving",
		other_minority_serving ~ "Other Minority Serving"
	),
	missing_text = "Missing") 
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
